# Blocks World Problem

Blocks World is a typical AI domain in which one imagines having a number of blocks (in our case a maximum of 6) identified by a number and a mechanical arm capable of performing certain actions that allow these blocks to be moved. This domain is typically used in search and planning problems in which, starting from an initial configuration, one is asked to find the actions to be performed by the mechanical arm so that an end state called goal is reached.

This program takes as input two images, one representing the initial state and one representing the goal state, from which it is able to extract configurations related to the blocks world. Once the states have been acquired, it allows the user to choose the search algorithm by which the set of moves necessary to move from one state to another will be found. At the end of the process an animation is created showing how the agent performs the required moves in order to go from the initial state to the goal state.
